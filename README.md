# paas-coding-interview

## Study case

* Create your own branch
* Write a simple CLI in Go / Python
* It should implement a workflow in sync command with the following steps:
  * Get a parameter with application_name
  * Activate Datadog downtime
  * Trigger ArgoCD app sync (The applicaiton is ready to be deployed, just need to trigger the sync)
  * Remove Datadog downtime

You must:
* Mock all real calls to Datadog/ArgoCD and write functions/methods which only retrieve hard coded struct base on service documentation
* Handle idempotency (what happen if the CLI fail in the middle of the run)
